# *Petrolisthes cinctipes* (Flat Porcelain Crab)

## Description

The flat porcelain crab, *Petrolisthes cinctipes*, has lots of colour variation - it can be light brown, reddish brown, dark brown, brown with a blue tinge or a vibrant blue colour (Jensen, 1995). It is also variable in size, with carapace width reaching up to 24 mm. This small intertidal shore crab has orange-red mouth parts and claw spots, as well as distinctly red antennae. The walking legs of *P. cinctipes* have small uncalcified windows along the joints. They frequently have one claw with a gap between the pincers (the purpose of which is unknown) and small round punctures along the claws from fighting with its rock-mates for space (Jensen, 1995).
Easily mistaken for the flattop porcelain crab, *P. cabrilloi*, these two species can be distinguished from one another through two key characteristics (Jensen, 2014). Firstly, *P. cinctipes* has hairless or limited hair on its walking legs and the carapus of its claws, while *P. cabrilloi* has distinctly hairy claws and legs. Secondly, the flattop is more common in sheltered areas, while the flat porcelain tends to avoid the fine sedimentation found in those areas. As such, *P. cinctipes* tends to be found in more rocky, wave-exposed areas (Jensen, 2014).

Flat porcelain crabs are found throughout the Pacific Northwest. Their range spans from Porcher Island, British Columbia to Santa Barbara, California (Fretwell, K., 2014). They live under rocks in the upper and middle intertidal, but generally avoid fine sediment. Due to this aversion to sand, they are primarily restricted to upper levels of beaches. Furthermore, they are often very abundant in California sea mussel beds (Fretwell, K., 2014).

P. cinctipes is a fairly omnivorous species (Cowles, 2006). They feed most frequently on plankton and detritus suspended in the water column. Flat porcelain crabs catch these small particles by waving their feather-like mouthparts, called maxillipeds and found on the underside of their head, through the water. P. cinctipes also occasionally eat macroalgae (seaweed) and dead animal tissue (Cowles, 2006).

P. cinctipes sexually reproduces continuously in California and in the spring in Puget Sound (Cowles, 2006). When ready to hatch, a fertilized egg clutch is laid by the female and is initially bright red, before fading to brownish red. A single egg clutch is often fertilized by multiple males, which is likely a reproductive advantage as it facilitates genetic diversity (Yockachonis, T., 2020).

## Questions

1. Is it a small (up to 24mm in body carapace length) intertidal crab with obnoxiously large claws? Yes - go to question 2.
2. Is it reddish brown, dark brown or blue with distinctly red antennae? Yes - go to question 3.
3. Does it have distinctly hairy legs and claws? No - this is P. cinctipes.
